## Track'n'Fit

#### Introduction

The app Track'n'Fit is designed to convert Calories to workouts so the user can know how  much activity is required to burn the consumed Calories. 

The users can set their weight in the app in pounds for a more realistic conversion. They would then have three choices:

 1. Enter the Calorie intake: in this case the app will display the number of repetitions or the duration in minute of the exercises that will burn that many Calories.
 2. Enter the number of Reps: in this case the app will display the equivalent number of reps or minutes in the other exercises. The number of Calories will also be displayed next to each exercises.
 3. Enter the duration of Minutes: Which is the same as above but for exercises which require time as opposed to reps.

There are a total of twelve exercises to choose from as listed below:

 - Push ups
 - Squats
 - Sit ups
 - Pull ups
 - Planks
 - Leg Lifts
 - Cycling
 - Swimming
 - Climbing Stairs
 - Walking
 - Jogging
 - Jumping Jacks

#### Interaction

When you first open Track'n'Fit, you will see the home screen, you can set your weight using the three dots on the upper right corner as displayed bellow:

<div><p><center>

<img src="http://s28.postimg.org/9geepoe59/image.png" width="268.8" height="460.8" align="right"/></center></p><BR CLEAR="both"></div>
<p></p>


Once you click on the dots, a drop down list will be displayed, choose "Enter Your Weight". In the text entry box that appears first, you can enter your weight in pounds. Press OK to continue.

<p></p>

Next from the dropdown list on the right, choose the setting that you want. You can either enter calories to know how much of each exercise you should do to burn them, or you can choose a certain exercise and enter the number of repetitions or duration of minutes to know what are they equivalent to in other exercises and calories.

</center></p><BR CLEAR="both"></div>
<p></p>

You can then simply enter the amount of calories, number of repetitions or duration of minutes to see the results.
