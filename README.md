#### Summary

The app Track'n'Fit is designed to convert Calories to workouts so the user can know how  much activity is required to burn the consumed Calories. 

The users can set their weight in the app in pounds for a more realistic conversion. They would then have three choices:

 1. Enter the Calorie intake: in this case the app will display the number of repetitions or the duration in minute of the exercises that will burn that many Calories.
 2. Enter the number of Reps: in this case the app will display the equivalent number of reps or minutes in the other exercises. The number of Calories will also be displayed next to each exercises.
 3. Enter the duration of Minutes: Which is the same as above but for exercises which require time as opposed to reps.

There are a total of twelve exercises to choose from as listed below:

 - Push ups
 - Squats
 - Sit ups
 - Pull ups
 - Planks
 - Leg Lifts
 - Cycling
 - Swimming
 - Climbing Stairs
 - Walking
 - Jogging
 - Jumping Jacks
